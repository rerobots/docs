# VPN-based instance with ROS and Brunel Hand

## Summary

In this tutorial, you are shown how to instantiate a workspace that has a Brunel
Hand and that is accessed over VPN.  If you want to see an example video that
you can reproduce, skip to the section [Commanding motion](#commanding-motion).

If you think that something is missing, or if you find errors, please [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact) or [open a
ticket](https://github.com/rerobots/docs/issues).

## Searching

To begin, sign-in to <https://rerobots.net>, and go to [the search
page](https://rerobots.net/search). It should look like the following:

![screenshot of the search page](figures/vpn_brunelhand_search.png)

For this tutorial, we want to use a workspace deployment that has the type
[`fixed_brunelhand`](/workspaces/fixed_brunelhand). If one is not already listed, enter "brunel" into the search
field, or try the following URL: <https://rerobots.net/search?q=fixed_brunelhand>

Click on the photo or the "deployment id" of one of the items in the search
results. You will get a brief description of the workspace, which should look
like the following:

![screenshot of the workspace deployment summary](figures/vpn_brunelhand_wdeployment_summary.png)

## Requesting an instance

To request to use the workspace deployment that you are viewing, click the
"request instance" button. The next page provides some choices about the
instance that you will create. It should look like:

![screenshot of the page to create a new instance](figures/vpn_brunelhand_new_instance_dialog.png)

Under "kind of connection", select "VPN". Then, request it. A reservation system
is under development, so your request might be denied if someone else started to
use the same workspace. If you encounter difficulty here, please [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact).

If your request is accepted, then you will be redirected to a page that shows
all of your active instances. Notice that there is a message at the top of the page:

> Your new workspace instance is initializing! Because you did not use an SSH key
> that is already associated with your user account, a new key pair was generated
> for this instance. The following link can be used to download the private key
> precisely once.

When you are ready, select the link "Download private key.", which will download
a file named `key.pem`. Be careful to only click the link when you are ready for
the download.

In the table of your instances, you will find the one that you just created. Its
status should be `INIT`, which indicates that it is initializing. If you select
it, then details will be shown that look like the following:

![status text of an initializing instance](figures/vpn_brunelhand_instance_init.png)

Creating a new VPN server for your instance can require up to 12 minutes, more
or less, because the certificate and key generation process is slow. Thus,
consider taking a break for 10 minutes before clicking the `refresh`
button. Eventually, the outcome should be `READY` or `INIT_FAIL`. If you get
`INIT_FAIL`, then something broke during initialization. In this case, you can
`terminate` the instance and repeat early steps of this tutorial, or [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact) for help. Thanks for your patience as we try
to make the rerobots service more robust.

If you get `READY`, then the workspace instance is ready for you!

## Your first log-in

Now that the workspace instance has the status of `READY`, find the section
"VPN" on the page and click the "add new client" button. The response might be
slow (approx. 10 seconds). When completed, there will be a new entry in the list
of "client identifiers" with a "one-time download" link. Like the URL for your
SSH key, this can be used precisely once. When ready, select "one-time download"
to get an OVPN file. If something goes wrong, then try "add new client"
again. (You can generate VPN credentials for as many clients as you want.)

![status text of ready instance](figures/vpn_brunelhand_instance_ready.png)

Import the OVPN file into your VPN client software. It contains client
credentials with which you can connect to the VPN of your instance, namely, a CA
certificate, a user certificate, and a user private key, along with VPN server
details. The details depend on your computer. If you have Mac OS, try
[Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/). If you have
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) or [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), then your
network control panel should have an option to connect to a VPN. Besides these
graphical tools, you can use the [openvpn](https://community.openvpn.net/)
command-line program. On Linux, the command would be like: `openvpn
client.ovpn`.

In many cases, the default configuration is to route *all* network traffic
through the VPN of your instance. If you only want to route packets through it
that involve VPN-specific hosts, then you might need to take some additional
action that depends on your client software. For example, in the GNOME network
configuration tool on Fedora, there is tab for "IPv4" in the "Add VPN" dialog,
where you can check a box next to "Use this connection only for resources on its
network".

When connected to the VPN, open a terminal, and try

```bash
ping rrc.local
```

Possibly after some delay, you should get successful pings. `rrc.local` is the
one and only Linux host that is part of your instance of the [`fixed_brunelhand`](/workspaces/fixed_brunelhand)
workspace type.

Recall earlier in the tutorial that you downloaded key.pem, which you must use
to connect via SSH. As a security precaution, permissions on the file must
prevent other users from reading it. Assuming that you moved key.pem into the
directory where you have a terminal, try

```bash
chmod 600 key.pem
```

Now, start a SSH session using this key,

```bash
ssh -i key.pem root@rrc.local
```

Note that in your instance, you have the root account. There is no need to use
`sudo`, so be careful. (You can create a new user account if you want.)

## Installing the Brunel Hand CLI tool

Now we can install [a small command-line program for the Brunel
hand](https://github.com/rerobots/brunel_hand_cli).
To do so, enter the following to get necessary packages:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get -y install python3 python3-virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 PY
source PY/bin/activate
pip install bhand
```

At the end of the above sequence, your instance will have installed the `bhand`
tool, which we will use to command motions. Check that it is installed and that
the Brunel Hand hardware is operational:

```bash
bhand
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
Printing diagnostics. (Try `-h` for help.)

## ROS streaming of webcams

To visualize the space, we will start ROS nodes that stream images from the
webcams. The instance already has the "desktop" installation of [ROS
Kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic), but for this tutorial, the following
packages must also be installed: [cv_camera](https://wiki.ros.org/cv_camera) and
[web_video_server](https://wiki.ros.org/web_video_server). To do so,

```bash
apt-get -y install ros-kinetic-cv-camera ros-kinetic-web-video-server
```

In this tutorial, the declaration of ROS nodes is through a
[roslaunch](https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch#Overview) file. Create a text file on
your computer called demo.launch and place the following in it:

```
<launch>
  <node name="video0" pkg="cv_camera" type="cv_camera_node">
    <param name="device_id" value="0" />
  </node>
  <node name="video1" pkg="cv_camera" type="cv_camera_node">
    <param name="device_id" value="1" />
  </node>
  <node name="webstreamer" pkg="web_video_server" type="web_video_server">
    <param name="address" value="0.0.0.0" />
    <param name="port" value="8080" />
    <param name="ros_threads" value="2" />
  </node>
</launch>
```

Save it, and copy it into the instance host:

```bash
scp -i key.pem demo.launch root@rrc.local:/root/
```

Start an SSH session with `rrc.local` again, and enter

```bash
roslaunch demo.launch
```

Then, direct your Web browser at <http://rrc.local:8080>. The video streams
listed are coming from the `web_video_server` ROS node.

## Commanding motion

Start another SSH session (something like `ssh -i key.pem root@rrc.local`) and

```bash
source PY/bin/activate
bhand --raw A3
```

which should end with a confirmation like

> Motors ENABLED

You can now send motion commands. For example,

```bash
bhand --raw G0
```

will cause a fist to form. Send the same command again to toggle between "open"
and "close":

```bash
bhand --raw G0
bhand --raw G0
```

and watch the video stream in your Web browser. Depending on the speed of your
Internet connection, there might be some delay in the video. If the video has
extreme lag, hit the refresh button.

![example video sequence showing the hand move](figures/vpn_brunelhand_demovideo.gif)

A brief help message for the CLI program `bhand` can be obtained by

```bash
bhand --help
```

and to get a help message from the firmware, try

```bash
bhand --fw-help
```

or, equivalently, `bhand --raw \?`. Technical specifications are available from
the [Brunel Hand product page](https://www.openbionics.com/shop/brunel-hand) by
[Open Bionics](https://www.openbionics.com/).

## Conclusion

When you are done, return to <https://rerobots.net/instances>, find the instance
that you created in the table, and push the `terminate` button.
