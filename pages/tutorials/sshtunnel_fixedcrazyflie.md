# SSH-tunnel-based instance with fixed Crazyflie

## Summary

In this tutorial, you are shown how to instantiate a workspace that is accessed
through an SSH tunnel. As an example, the workspace type demonstrated here is
[`fixed_crazyflie`](/workspaces/fixed_crazyflie.html), but the basic steps can be applied to any type for which SSH
tunneling is an option.

If you want to see an example video that you can reproduce, skip to the section
[Reviewing results](#reviewing-results).

If you think that something is missing, or if you find errors, please [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact) or [open a
ticket](https://github.com/rerobots/docs/issues).

## Searching

To begin, sign-in to <https://rerobots.net>, and go to [the search
page](https://rerobots.net/search).  As an example in this tutorial, we will use
a workspace deployment that has the type [`fixed_crazyflie`](/workspaces/fixed_crazyflie.html). Note, however, the
basic steps can be applied anywhere that an SSH-tunnel-based connection is
desired. If one is not already listed, enter "fixed_crazyflie" into the search
field, or try the following URL:
<https://rerobots.net/search?q=fixed_crazyflie&maxl=u>
There should be at least one match, as in the following screenshot:

![screenshot of the search page](figures/sshtunnel_fixedcrazyflie_search.png)

Click on the photo or the "deployment id" of one of the items in the search
results. You will get a brief description of the workspace.

## Requesting an instance

To request to use the workspace deployment that you are viewing, click the
"request instance" button. The next page provides some choices about the
instance that you will create. It should look like:

![screenshot of the page to create a new instance](figures/sshtunnel_fixedcrazyflie_new_instance_dialog.png)

Under "kind of connection", select "SSH tunnel". For the SSH public key that
provides authorization for remote log-in to the instance, you can select one
that you [previously uploaded](/web/uploading-ssh-public-keys), or you
can have a new key pair generated for you as part of instantiation. When you are
ready, request the instance.  A reservation system is under development, so your
request might be denied if someone else started to use the same workspace. If
you encounter difficulty here, please [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact).

If your request is accepted, then you will be redirected to a [page that shows
all of your active instances](https://rerobots.net/instances). If you selected
to generate a new SSH key pair, then notice that there is now a message at the
top of the page:

> Your new workspace instance is initializing! Because you did not use an SSH key
> that is already associated with your user account, a new key pair was generated
> for this instance. The following link can be used to download the private key
> precisely once.

In this case, when you are ready, select the link "Download private key." to
download a file named `key.pem`. Be careful to only click the link when you are
ready for the download. If you selected to use one of [the SSH keys already
associated with your account](https://rerobots.net/sshkeys), then there is no
link to "download private key" because it is assumed that you already have the
corresponding private key.

In the table of your instances, you will find the one that you just created. Its
status should be `INIT`, which indicates that it is initializing.

## Your first log-in

After several seconds or minutes, the instance will be READY as in the following
example screenshot:

![status text of ready instance](figures/sshtunnel_fixedcrazyflie_instancedetails.png)

In the details panel, an IP address and port number are listed. On this address
and port there is an SSH server listening for incoming connections to the main
host of your instance.  Also, notice the subsection titled "firewall rules". It
contains a table of rules that determine which hosts can send packets to the
SSH server that is listening for your instance. Note that even if
packets are allowed to reach the SSH server, it is necessary to have the correct
private key to log-in, independently of the firewall rules.

The default behavior is to drop all incoming packets, so it is at least
necessary to add one rule to allow you to log-in. There are several methods to
determine the externally visible address from which you are accessing the
Internet. For example, at the terminal, try

```bash
curl https://ipinfo.io/
```

New rules can be added in the panel titled "modify firewall rules", as shown in the screenshot:

![screenshot of the form for modifying firewall rules](figures/sshtunnel_fixedcrazyflie_modifyfirewall.png)

Addresses are specified in CIDR notation ([RFC
4632](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)). The default (if no netmask is
declared) is `/32`, that is, only from the given address. While for a long-lived
instance accepting traffic from anywhere is usually not desirable, you can use
`0.0.0.0/0` to do so.
There should now be a row in the table of firewall rules: `0.0.0.0/0 ACCEPT`.

To log-in, open a terminal. Assuming that your private key is in the local
directory in the file key.pem, then,

```bash
ssh -i key.pem -p 2211 root@147.75.69.207
```

If you selected an SSH key that is uploaded to your rerobots account, then the
switch `-i key.pem` can be omitted or changed as needed.
The hostkey presented by the SSH server can be compared with the one listed in
the details panel (example is shown in screenshot earlier in this tutorial).

## Installing required packages

To visualize the space, we will start a ROS node that streams images from the
webcam. The instance already has the "desktop" installation of [ROS
Kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic), but for this tutorial, the
package [cv_camera](https://wiki.ros.org/cv_camera) must also be installed. To
do so,

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-cv-camera
```

To send thrust commands to the [Crazyflie
quadrotor](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) in this tutorial, `cfheadless`
must be installed. It is part of the [Crazyflie client
software](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python).
The current release can be installed from

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-pyqt5
pip3 install -U pip
pip install cfclient
```

Finally, create a minimal configuration by creating the file
/root/.config/cfclient/config.json with the contents

```json
{
  "enable_zmq_input": true
}
```

This can be achieved in one command,

```bash
mkdir -p /root/.config/cfclient && echo '{"enable_zmq_input": true}' > /root/.config/cfclient/config.json
```

Finally, start `cfheadless` to connect to a Crazyflie that is attached to the
host via USB:

```bash
cfheadless -u usb://0
```

## Running an open-loop controller and recording a video

Now that `cfheadless` is using the terminal for output, open a new terminal and
log-in again to the instance host via SSH. Create a file named demo.py with the
following contents:

```python
import time
import zmq

sender = zmq.Context().socket(zmq.PUSH)
sender.connect('tcp://127.0.0.1:1212')

sender.send_json({
    'version': 1,
    'ctrl': {
	'roll': 0.0,
	'pitch': 0.0,
	'yaw': 0.0,
	'thrust': 0.0
    }
})

time.sleep(1)

sender.send_json({
    'version': 1,
    'ctrl': {
	'roll': 0.0,
	'pitch': 0.0,
	'yaw': 0.0,
	'thrust': 35.0
    }
})

time.sleep(2)

sender.send_json({
    'version': 1,
    'ctrl': {
	'roll': 0.0,
	'pitch': 0.0,
	'yaw': 0.0,
	'thrust': 0.0
    }
})
```

This Python program commands zero thrust, small positive thrust, and after 2
seconds, zero thrust again.

To create a demo log file, we will run the ROS node `cv_camera_node`, `rosbag
record`, and `demo.py` (the file defined above), each of which requires its own
terminal. To do so, start as many new SSH log-ins as needed, or use a terminal
multiplexing tool like `screen` or `tmux`, and run each of

```bash
roscore
rosrun cv_camera cv_camera_node
rosbag record -a
python3 demo.py
```

After demo.py finishes, kill the `rosbag record` process and compress the log
file:

```bash
rosbag compress *bag
```

Then, download the compressed log file to your local storage. There are several
tools available to copy files via an SSH connection, such as `scp`. For example,
you might use a command like the following:

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/unodist -P 2210 root@147.75.69.207:/root/2018-02-27-00-05-15.bag .
```

Notice that to specify the port number used by `scp`, the switch is uppercase
`-P`.

## Reviewing results

Assuming that you have ROS installed locally, the
[rosbag](https://wiki.ros.org/rosbag) file can be played back at a slower speed
and visually reviewed in [rqt](https://wiki.ros.org/rqt). After starting
`roscore`, run a `rosbag play` process by a command like

```bash
rosbag play -r 0.25 2018-02-27-00-05-15.bag
```

Open the `rqt` GUI, select the drop-down menu "Plugins", then "Visualization",
and "Image View". The Image View plugin can display images from the
`/cv_camera/image_raw` ROS topic, which contains data from the webcam in the
workspace of this tutorial.

## Conclusion

When you are done, return to <https://rerobots.net/instances>, find the instance
that you created in the table, and push the `terminate` button.
