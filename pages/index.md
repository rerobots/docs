# FAQ

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a suite of tools for building and sharing robots.

We maintain a variety of robots that can be remotely accessed in a *bare metal*
cloud-computing pattern.
You can develop software on these robots interactively through a Web-based IDE,
demonstrated in videos of [multi_kobuki](https://vimeo.com/465989844) and
[fixed_misty2](https://vimeo.com/488264658) workspaces.
You can also create your own applications that leverage it with popular programming languages,
like [Python](https://pypi.org/project/rerobots/).


## What is hardshare?

You can share your own robot or {% abbr title="Internet of Things" %}IoT{% /abbr %} device using
[hardshare](https://hardshare.dev/).
This involves the same infrastructure as rerobots except at the edge, where the
[hardshare client](https://github.com/rerobots/hardshare) presents your devices
to rerobots servers.


## How do I begin?
