# FAQ

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a suite of tools for building and sharing robots.

We maintain a variety of robots that can be remotely accessed just as you would
any cloud computing service.
You can develop software on these robots interactively through a Web-based
{% abbr title="integrated development environment" %}IDE{% /abbr %},
demonstrated in videos of [multi_kobuki](https://vimeo.com/465989844) and
[fixed_misty2](https://vimeo.com/488264658) workspaces.
You can also create your own applications that leverage it with popular programming languages,
like [Python](https://pypi.org/project/rerobots/).


## What is hardshare?

The software running at the edge that connects devices to the core infrastructure is known as
[hardshare](/hardshare/intro).
You can share your own robot or {% abbr title="Internet of Things" %}IoT{% /abbr %} device using
the [hardshare client](https://github.com/rerobots/hardshare).
