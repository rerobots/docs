### Summary

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">UPDATE: This workshop is completed. We will continue to update the <a href="#references">References</a>.</div>

This [RSS 2021 workshop](https://roboticsconference.org/) will teach you about starting your own company if you recently earned (or will soon earn) your PhD.
While there is a lot of prior writing about startups in general, there is not a lot about robotics companies, and even less about doing so shortly after grad school.
For something as idiosyncratic as founding a company to realize your dreams, the best lessons come from those who have gone before you.
