The `misty-blockly` kind of sandbox includes a Blockly-based programming environment.
It is only applicable to workspace types that include a Misty robot, e.g.,
[basic_misty2](/workspaces/basic_misty2).

Besides common programming elemenst like while-loops, the editor has blocks for
robot actions, like moving the head, and sensor readings, like whether the
bumpers are pressed.
